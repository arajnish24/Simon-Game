# Simon-Game
The Simon Game is a classic memory skill game where players must repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. Each round, the game adds one new color to the pattern, and the player must click the buttons in the same order. The game tests memory, focus, and speed, one wrong move and itâ€™s game over! Simple to play, but challenging to master.
